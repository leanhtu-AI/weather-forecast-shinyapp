## Description😎

- This was an assignment in my basic R course in school that involved taking weather forecasts and posting them on the website through 👉[shinyapp.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/). 

- With the weather forecast, I already took an API from the website [openweathermap](https://home.openweathermap.org/), of course, you are welcome to create your API. Please go to the OpenWeatherMap link and create an account.

## Installation🤖

- If you feel interested and want to reproduce my work, you can use the line code below in the R script to install all the packages. This make sure everthing will go on smoothly

```bash
install.packages(c("shiny", "leaflet", "jsonlite", "ggplot2", "tidyverse", "shinydashboard", "dplyr", "shinyMatrix", "plotly"))

```
- All your work then is just follow the shiny tutorial for deploy.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## ***R version📢❗❗❗❗***
- Up to Nov 9th 2023, the latest version of R, which is R-4.3.2 is not ready for deployment on the Shinyapp. So if you want to build an app by yourself, you need to download an older version like 4.3.1 or 4.3.0.
  
- In the case you have already R-4.3.2, don't worry, you can easily transfer to an older version with no conflict in Rstudio through the tools bar.
  
- In tools, click on Global Options and change the R version.

- Don't worry about the packages you have installed in other R versions, they still working.
