## Description😎

1. This was an assignment in my basic R course in school that involved taking weather forecast and posting them on the website through 👉[shinyapp.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/). 

2. With weather forecast, i already take an API from website [openweathermap](https://home.openweathermap.org/), if you want use your own API, please go to it and create an account.

Use the line code below in R script to install all the packages.

```bash
